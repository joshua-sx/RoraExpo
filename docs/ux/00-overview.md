# 00 — Overview (Rora UX System)
This document is the entry point for the Rora UX system as a set of **Cursor-friendly specs**.
## What this system is
- A set of **rules, patterns, and screen blueprints** that keep Rider + Driver experiences consistent.
- A way to make UX decisions quickly by using **constraints**.
## Prime goals
- **Clarity:** the user always knows what state they are in and what happens next.
- **Trust:** the product feels predictable, calm, and recorded (especially in cash + negotiation contexts).
- **Speed:** decisions are made with minimal cognitive load.
## Core patterns
- **Map as context + bottom sheet as decision layer**.
- **Cards as decision units**.
- **Soft commitment → hard confirmation**.
- **One primary action per screen/state**.
## How to use these docs
- Start with [`01-foundational-principles.md`]({{http://01-foundational-principles.md}}) and [`03-rora-ux-constitution.md`]({{http://03-rora-ux-constitution.md}}).
- When designing a screen, open:
	- [`30-bottom-sheet-standard.md`]({{http://30-bottom-sheet-standard.md}})
	- [`40-decision-hierarchy.md`]({{http://40-decision-hierarchy.md}})
	- [`42-cta-policy.md`]({{http://42-cta-policy.md}})
	- the relevant Rider/Driver blueprint doc.
## Definitions
- **Rider vs Driver:** Rider UX is reassurance + comparison. Driver UX is operational + fast decisions.
- **Discovery vs Commitment:** Discovery is reversible. Commitment is explicit and logged.
- **Context vs Content:** Map = context. Sheet/cards = content + action.
