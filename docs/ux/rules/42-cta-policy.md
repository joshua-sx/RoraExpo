# 42 — CTA Policy
## Rule 1 — One primary CTA
- Each screen/state has exactly one primary CTA.
## Rule 2 — Secondary CTA is optional
- Max one secondary CTA.
- Secondary must be visually weaker.
## Rule 3 — Card tap can be the CTA
- In offer lists, the primary CTA can be “select this offer” by tapping the card.
## Rule 4 — Don’t mix navigation with commitment
- Navigation actions (Back, Close) must not trigger commitment.
## Rule 5 — Destructive actions are separated
- Cancel/Decline must not sit adjacent to Confirm in equal weight.
## Examples
- Offers list: Card tap = primary, “Keep looking” = secondary.
- Confirm step: “Confirm” = primary, “Change selection” = secondary.
