# 43 — Progressive Disclosure Policy
## Principle
Show only what matters now. Defer the rest.
## Rules
- The first view should include only the information needed to decide.
- Details must be reachable in 1 extra step (Details, expand sheet, etc.).
- Never hide information that changes the user’s decision.
## Where to use it
- Offers:
	- show top 3
	- hide remaining offers
- Pricing:
	- show a single anchor number
	- hide breakdown
- Driver/rider profiles:
	- show essentials first
	- deeper profile optional
## Anti-patterns
- Exposing advanced controls in the main flow.
- Showing all metrics “because we have them.”
