- Badges with tooltips/meaning.
- Guest-first flow with a later “claim” step.
## Forbidden
- Multiple primary CTAs competing in one view.
- Countdown timers during discovery.
- Dense tables for offers.
- Full pricing breakdown as default.
- Stacked bottom sheets.
- “Flexibility” that increases error in high-stakes steps.
