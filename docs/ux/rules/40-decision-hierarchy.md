# 40 — Decision Hierarchy
Think like a bouncer: only the most important information is allowed into the top of the screen.
## Rider hierarchy (highest → lowest)
1. **State** (Searching / Offers / Waiting / Active)
2. **Price anchor** (Rora Fare or chosen offer)
3. **Next action** (single primary CTA)
4. **Trust signals** (verification, badges)
5. **Route summary** (origin → destination)
6. **Secondary info** (distance, labels, notes)
7. **Everything else** behind Details
## Driver hierarchy
1. **Request state** (New / Selected / Active)
2. **Pickup + destination**
3. **Price**
4. **Accept/Counter/Decline** controls
5. **Rider identity** (minimal)
6. **Notes**
## Rule
If a lower-priority item visually wins over a higher-priority item, the screen is wrong.
