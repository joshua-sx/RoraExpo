# 63 — Badge & Trust Signals
## Purpose
Badges are **small trust cues**, not decoration.
## Rules
- Badges must have consistent meaning.
- Meaning must be accessible (tooltip/details).
- Do not show too many badges (noise).
## Examples (conceptual)
- Verified ID
- Verified vehicle
- Rora Pro
## Placement
- Near identity (driver/rider name)
- Smaller than price and primary CTA
