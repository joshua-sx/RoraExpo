# 64 — Status & Feedback System
## Principle
Users must always know:
- what is happening
- what they can do
- what happens next
## Components
- Inline status text
- Loading indicator
- Toast for transient updates
- Empty states
## Rules
- Avoid silent loading.
- Avoid indefinite spinners with no explanation.
- Use calm, plain language.
## Examples (states)
- “Looking for drivers…”
- “Offer received”
- “No drivers yet. Expanding search…”
