# 60 — Card System
## Card purpose
Cards are **decision units**: each card contains enough information to choose without drilling into another screen.
## Card anatomy (standard)
- Header row: title + optional badge(s)
- Main value: the key metric (price, ETA)
- Supporting lines: 1–2 lines
- Optional: secondary action (rare)
## Interaction rules
- Entire card is tappable.
- Avoid nested tap targets.
- Keep layout consistent across contexts.
## Spacing + rhythm
- Use consistent padding across cards.
- Avoid changing card structure per screen.
