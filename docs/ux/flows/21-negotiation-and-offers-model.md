# 21 — Negotiation & Offers Model
## Price concepts
- **Anchor price (Rora Fare):** the default reference price.
- **Offer:** a driver’s response to the anchor (accept or counter).
- **Chosen price:** the price associated with the selected offer.
## Rider view rules
- Offers are displayed as **cards**.
- Emphasize **top 3** offers; disclose the rest behind “+X more.”
- Do not show a dense breakdown.
## Driver view rules
- Driver sees route summary + anchor price first.
- Countering is one tap away.
## Allowed negotiation behaviors
- Driver can:
	- accept anchor
	- counter
	- decline
- Rider can:
	- compare
	- select one offer
	- change selection before commitment
## Forbidden negotiation behaviors
- “Punishment” UX (shaming copy, warnings that negotiation is bad).
- Countdown timers during discovery.
- Multi-step counter flows that feel like a form.
## Labels (optional)
- “Good deal” / “Pricier than usual” may be used as subtle tags.
- Labels must never block selection.
