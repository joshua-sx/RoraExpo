# 31 — Map as Context Standard
## Principle
The map is **context**, not content.
## What the map is for
- Spatial grounding:
	- “Where am I?”
	- “Where is pickup/destination?”
	- “Where is the driver (if shown)?”
## What the map is not for
- A canvas for dense controls.
- A place where primary decisions happen.
## Rules
- The primary CTA never lives on the map layer.
- If the sheet is expanded, map interactions can be reduced/disabled.
- Keep map annotations minimal:
	- current location
	- pickup + destination pins
	- route line (when relevant)
## Trust
- Use the map to reinforce reality:
	- route shown matches what the user chose
	- driver position (when available) matches status/ETA
